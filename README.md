In order to run it, reddit_classification.ipynb file has to execute so that it generates distilbert_model.pth. and this binary file is added to under distill_bert folder as .pth extension only. then the app.py file has to execute and it will render the index.html page.
secondly other than distillbert model. Our team tried with several other pretrained model like svm,logistic regression,random forest ... but their's accuracy were less tan distillbertmodel.
we tried running pretrained trained on twitter social_media dataset under strng_text_classification folder and finally merging all results for final prediction.
so we have two folders one for distillbert_model that has a virtual assistance support for mental health . and other only classification and comparing accuracy.
